# odin-recipes

This project is to create a basic website containing three recipes. I have chosen to do 'Dr Seuss' recipes, as it seemed fun. I used the command line to create directories and files, as well as to add, commit and push to GitHub. Using HTML I practised relative links to pages and images, used tags to define paragraphs, ordered and unordered lists and headings.

Please note these recipes are just for fun, and were created from a handful of recipes I found online. The recipes and images aren't mine.
