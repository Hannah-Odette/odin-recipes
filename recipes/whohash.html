    <h3>'He cleaned out that ice box as quick as a flash. Why, the Grinch even took their last can of Who hash.'</h3>
    <p>From Dr Seuss' 'The Grinch', in the book 'Who hash' comes from a can, as that doesn't sound very appetizing, we won't be putting it in a can (although you could, if you really wanted to.)</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>425g potatoes</li>
        <li>1 can of luncheon meat (e.g spam)</li>
        <li>1/2 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tbsp oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel and dice the potatoes.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil over medium heat. Add the potatoes and meat, occasionally tossing, and cook until lightly browned (around 10 mins.)</li>
        <li>Add onions and cook until tender (around 5-7 mins.)</li>
        <li>Serve, preferably on a plate, though you can add to can for authenticity.</li>
    </ol>
